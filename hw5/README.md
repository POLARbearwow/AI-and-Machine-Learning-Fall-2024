# Project Description: Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) Implementation and Evaluation

### 1. Develop a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) Model Using NumPy:
   - Create a Python program that leverages NumPy to implement an MLP capable of handling any number of layers and units per layer.
   - Ensure that the program includes both the forward and backward propagation processes.

### 2. Implement Mini-batch and Stochastic Gradient Descent Updates:
   - Write code to update the model parameters using both mini-batch and stochastic gradient descent methods.
   - Ensure that these updates are integrated into the training process of the MLP model.

### 3. Cross-Validation Implementation:
   - Develop code for k-fold cross-validation to assess the model's performance.
   - This should allow for the evaluation of different hyperparameters and their impact on model accuracy.

### 4. Nonlinear Function Approximation:
   - Select a complex nonlinear function with a single input and a single output.
   - Generate a dataset by adding noise to the function's output.
   - Utilize the MLP model with various hyperparameters (number of layers, number of units per layer) to approximate the nonlinear function.
   - Use k-fold cross-validation to determine which set of hyperparameters provides the best approximation.
   - Demonstrate the results and discuss the findings.

### 5. Classifier Performance Evaluation:
   - Create a dataset similar to the one depicted on page 14 of the provided PPT of MLP lecture.
   - Experiment with the MLP model using different hyperparameters (number of layers, number of units per layer) to classify the dataset.
   - Validate the model's classification capabilities using k-fold cross-validation and identify the best performing configuration.
   - Demonstrate the classification results and evaluate the model's performance using accuracy, recall, precision, and F1 score metrics.
