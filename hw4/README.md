 Use the data set of previous homework assignment, namely wine.data.
Remove one class of wine samples from the dataset, retaining the other two classes to generate a new dataset. Consider the logistic regression model and cross-entropy loss function to address the binary classification problem of wine.
1. Write code to split the dataset into a training set and a test set in the ratio of (0.7, 0.3).
2. Write codes for Mini-batch update and Stochastic update to train the model.
3. Use the trained model to make predictions on the test set, and write code to evaluate the model's classification performance using Accuracy, recall, precision, and F1 score.
4. Analyze and conclude the difference between perceptron and logistic regression model.
